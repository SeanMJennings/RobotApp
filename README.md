# Robot App

A take-home assessment written in C# with a very basic functional-programming approach using TDD and DDD.

Console app purposefully excluded - you can only run the tests. Do you believe it works?

Would we be better off just using F#? Have a functional core for apps and can use C# at application boundaries with third-party libraries where F# struggles?
